## Project Description: 

In this project, we analyzed credit card fraud dataset by DHANUSH NARAYANAN R from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud). After our initial analysis of the data, we then utilized the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier in order to create a model to predict fradulent cases based on the features provided.
