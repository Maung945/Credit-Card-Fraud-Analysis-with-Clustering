Project Description
Sign into Kaggle, then look through their 'competitions' or their 'datasets' for one that interests your team.  There are many types of projects, some covering machine learning topics that we did not cover in class.  However, you should be able to find projects in:
1) Map/Reduce
2) Linear Regression
3) Logistic Regression
4) Clustering
You do not have to choose one of these, you can branch out if you want.

Download the data from Kaggle.  If you are using data from one of the competitions, sign up for the competition, download the data (then solve the problem and submit your results!).
Perform the suggested analysis, then report on your work.  If you can, compare your results with other submissions to Kaggle.
When you are done, write a report indicating:
1) Who is on your team! (very important)
2) Which dataset/competition you chose.
3) What approach you took.  What steps did you take to clean the data, improve the results, etc.
4) What are your results.  How did you choose to visualize the results (perhaps show  different graphs/charts/views to highlight your conclusions)
5) How did your results compare (if that information is available)
6) What worked well, what not so well.
