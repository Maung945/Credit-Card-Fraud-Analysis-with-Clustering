## Project Description: 

In this project, we analyzed credit card fraud dataset by DHANUSH NARAYANAN R from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud). After our initial analysis of the data, we then utilized the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier in order to create a model to predict fradulent cases based on the features provided. 

## Running Code: 

1. Clone the git repo to local repository
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud)
4. Unzip file to access dataset (should be called `archive.csv`)
5. Move dataset file to the same directory as [Capstone.ipynb] (./Capstone.ipynb)
